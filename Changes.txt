Revision history for Perl extension Javascript::MD5.

1.05  Fri Oct 21 14:27:00 2005
	- No code changes (ouside new() ), so no need to upgrade
	- Simplify code in new() to no longer check if caller is an object
		as per the new standard on such matters. Personally, I don't care :-)
	- Add more things to MANIFEST.SKIP
	- Regenerate META.yml with Module::Build V 0.2611 to correct a faulty
		META.yml output by V 0.24 which falsely said 'provides: {}',
		which in turn stopped the PAUSE indexer from finding the MD5.pm file,
		which in turn meant this module was omitted from the master index:
		ftp://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/modules/01modules.index.html

1.04  Tue Jul 20 20:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.03  Tue Apr  27 14:59:04 2004
	- Replace Yahoo!'s version of the Javascript with Paul Johnston's version,
		from his web site: http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5
	- Change the name of the function you call in your submit button code,
		from RetMD5() - the Yahoo! name - to str2hex_md5() - a name more in keeping
		with Paul's naming convention
	- Add 2 extra functions, str2b64_md5() and str2str_md5(), to return other versions
		of the digest

1.02  Tue Apr  13 13:13:13 2004
	- There are no code changes in this version
	- Document the optional parameter to the 'javascript' method
	- Add a section to the docs about CGI form submission, including calling the onClick event handler

1.01  Tue Mar  16 14:36:00 2004
	- Correct the docs, which somehow got chopped off in V 1.00
	- There are no code changes, so there is no need to upgrade

1.00  Fri Mar  05 10:23:29 2004
	- Original version
	- The original Javascript code from Yahoo is shipped as yahoo.js.
		See http://4.11.205.206/yahoo.zip.
		Many thanks to Mark S Pryor for telling me about yahoo.js
	- I have deleted from that code some functions which were not called, changed all
		" to ', and made the CGI form field name, by default 'password', a parameter
	- The program in the synopsis is in the examples/ directory

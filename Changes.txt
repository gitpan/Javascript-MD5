	- Original version
	- The original Javascript code from Yahoo is shipped as yahoo.js.
		See http://4.11.205.206/yahoo.zip.
		Many thanks to Mark S Pryor for telling me about yahoo.js
	- I have deleted from that code some functions which were not called, changed all
		" to ', and made the CGI form field name, by default 'password', a parameter
	- The program in the synopsis is in the examples/ directory
